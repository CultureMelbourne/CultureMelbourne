            <p class="mx-auto" style="max-width: 90%;">Gilbert Lau opened Flower Drum in 1975 in Chinatown. Its reputation for restrained opulence endures to this day. This fine-dining Cantonese restaurant has won multiple national and international awards. It's known for its delicate and finessed signature dishes, like baked crab and Peking duck. Service is almost psychic here – the waitstaff seem to anticipate your every need. Insiders ask for dishes from the unpublished chefs’ menu.</p>

            <p class="mx-auto" style="max-width: 90%;">A reliable yum cha favourite in the heart of Chinatown, you can fit the whole family around Crystal Jade's large tables. Each dish brings the world’s best ingredients to Melbourne. Including seasonal seafood, fresh out of the tank. Instead of coming around on trolleys, you tick off your selections on a list. Try the famous melon soup, served in a hollowed-out melon. Or go for dumplings stacked in steamers; ginger and prawn, or pork and coriander.</p>
