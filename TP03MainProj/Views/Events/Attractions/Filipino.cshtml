            <p class="mx-auto" style="max-width: 90%;">
                What started as a spot serving occasional Filipino specials has turned into a cult-status cafe for Filo expats. Formally known as The Basement, Ceree has moved to new digs in Spring Street. The cafe is loved most of all for its hearty silog: a breakfast set of garlic rice and fried eggs, served with a side of juicy meat. Other local treats include sweet and sticky karioka rice balls and ube sponge cake. Follow Ceree on Instagram to see what's on the menu.
